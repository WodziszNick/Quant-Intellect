# Autonomy Trader ðŸ“ˆ
Autonomy Trader is a full stack trading app built on python, postgreSQL and timescaleDB for the database, FastAPI web framework, Jinja's template engine, and Alpaca's REST api for making trades through their broker. 

# Contributions
Autonomy Trader is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

# Use
Autonomy Trader is made to automate a day traderâ€™s trading if they donâ€™t know how to program their self by the ability to select pre-programmed strategies for stocks. It obtains graphical visualization, updated stocks, prices, order histories, and push notifications to keep the trader up to date with the trades the program places.
