# Trade Hacker ðŸ“ˆ
Trade Hacker is a full stack trading app built on python, postgreSQL and timescaleDB for the database, FastAPI web framework, Jinja's template engine, and Alpaca's REST api for making trades through their broker. 

Autonomy Trader is made to automate a day traderâ€™s trading if they donâ€™t know how to program their self by the ability to select pre-programmed strategies for stocks. It obtains graphical visualization, updated stocks, prices, order histories, and push notifications to keep the trader up to date with the trades the program places. 

I currently have it hosted locally. If it is still running on my machine then you can access it by https://328a3ebb6296.ngrok.io/.
